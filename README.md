# Markup Interactive Language Format
#####  maturita project and personal project
##### by David Šimek and Petr Hruška
##### publishing under <ins>GNU GENENRAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3.0</ins> (more in LICENSE file)

### idea:
- simple markup language usable by non developers
- free transpiler and other tools
- easy to use UI (in future)

### is it just markdown copy???
It really seems similar to markdown, I see than and one can argue it has nothing new compared to markdown. That might be valid point, but it has different syntax approach and target group.  
##### differences from markdown:    
- no xml markings
- interactivity
- per line evaluation (with some non-breaking exceptions)

### motivation:
This project has 2 main goals.
- make us get maturita without passing maturita exam
- provide easy and free workflow for making:
    - presentations
    - basic webs
    - teaching/learning materials
    - good looking notes

### technology used:
- haskell
- html
